# Denoising Diffusion Models for Dynamic Sky Image Generation

This repository contains the code from the research conducted during my bachelor's thesis at
Charles University, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Prague, Czech Republic.

## Installation
A key part of this work was developed in Jupyter notebooks due to their convenience in research projects.
We used Conda as a package and environment management system for installing and managing software packages
and dependencies. To set up an environment using the `environment.yaml` file provided in the root of this
repository, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Conda
If you haven't already installed Conda, please follow the guide provided on the [Official Conda website](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/) to install it for your OS.
### 2. Clone project
```shell
git clone https://github.com/gladkykhse/sky-diffusion.git && cd sky-diffusion
```
### 2. Create a Conda Environment
```shell
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```
### 3. Activate the Environment
```shell
conda activate sky_diffusion
```
